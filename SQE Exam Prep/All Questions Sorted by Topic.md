    - "You are a member of a development team approaching the final stages of testing a software product called SysTUS V3.0 which consists of 70,000 new lines of code and 415 bugs have been found and fixed so far. As a result of competitive pressures your product manager has requested an assessment of the reliability of V3.0 of the software and the likely maintenance effort if the software were to be released immediately. Use defect pooling and density data to provide your assessment." (2023)

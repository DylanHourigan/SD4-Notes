- **Understanding Software Errors, Faults, and Failures**

	Explain your understanding of software errors, software faults and software failures and explain why developers and users view these differently." (2018, 2021, 2023)
	
	### Understanding Software Errors, Faults, and Failures
	
	**Software Errors:**  
	Software errors refer to mistakes made during the coding process, often due to human oversight. These are incorrect actions or omissions by developers during the creation of software, such as logical errors, misinterpretation of requirements, or incorrect implementation of algorithms. For example, using an incorrect formula in a calculation can be considered an error.
	
	**Software Faults (Defects):**  
	Faults are the manifestations of errors within the software code. A fault occurs when an error results in an incorrect or unintended piece of code. It is the specific instance of a problem within the software that can lead to incorrect behavior. For instance, a fault might be an incorrect condition in an "if" statement that prevents the software from functioning correctly under certain conditions.
	
	**Software Failures:**  
	Failures occur when faults in the software are executed, resulting in the system not performing as expected. This is the visible outcome experienced by users when the software does not meet specified requirements or behaves unexpectedly. For example, a failure can occur when an application crashes due to unhandled exceptions.
	
	### Differing Perspectives of Developers and Users
	
	**Developers' Perspective:**
	
	- **Focus on Faults:** Developers are primarily concerned with identifying and correcting faults. They engage in activities like debugging, code reviews, and testing to detect and rectify defects before the software reaches the user. The internal quality of the software, such as maintainability and performance, is of significant concern.
	- **Technical Metrics:** Developers use technical metrics, such as defect density and code coverage, to assess the quality and readiness of the software. They may also consider economic factors like technical debt and the cost of quality, balancing the need for thorough testing with project timelines and budgets.
	- **Verification and Validation (V&V):** Developers distinguish between verification (ensuring the software is built correctly) and validation (ensuring the right software is built), focusing on both to ensure a high-quality product.
	
	**Users' Perspective:**
	
	- **Focus on Failures:** Users primarily experience the software in terms of its failures. Their concern is whether the software performs as expected without issues. Users typically do not differentiate between the underlying faults and the visible failures; their main focus is on the functionality and reliability of the software.
	- **Usability and Reliability:** For users, the quality of software is often synonymous with usability and reliability. They expect the software to be intuitive, efficient, and free from any noticeable bugs or issues. Even minor bugs can significantly impact user satisfaction.
	- **Expectations and Communication:** Users often expect a seamless experience and may not understand or accept that some level of imperfection (e.g., minor bugs) is common in software products. This difference in expectation can lead to dissatisfaction if users encounter issues, even if they are technically minor from a developer's perspective.
	
	### Conclusion
	
	The differences in perspectives between developers and users stem from their distinct roles and expectations. Developers focus on the technical correctness and completeness of the software, prioritizing the identification and resolution of faults. Users, however, are more concerned with the practical, everyday performance of the software, equating quality with the absence of visible failures. This dichotomy can sometimes lead to misunderstandings or unmet expectations, highlighting the importance of effective communication and alignment between software development teams and end-users.

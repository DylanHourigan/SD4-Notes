	To achieve high-quality software development, companies typically implement a comprehensive Software Quality Assurance (SQA) system composed of several key components:
	
	1. **System Testing**: This is a critical phase where the fully integrated software is tested on target hardware. System testing ensures that the software functions as intended and meets the specified requirements. It includes both functional and structural testing to verify system-level functions and the interaction between subsystems. Additionally, it addresses non-functional aspects such as performance, security, and recovery, ensuring the software is robust under various conditions.
	    
	2. **Vertical Integration and Continuous Integration (CI)**:
	    
	    - **Vertical Integration** focuses on integrating components according to their functions, allowing for early testing of new functionalities along with existing ones. This approach ensures that the software system grows incrementally, with each new feature thoroughly tested.
	    - **Continuous Integration (CI)** is a practice where code changes are frequently integrated into a shared repository, followed by automated builds and tests. CI provides immediate feedback on code quality, detects defects early, and ensures that the software is always in a deployable state. This reduces integration issues and improves overall code quality.
	3. **Verification and Validation (V&V)**:
	    
	    - **Verification** ensures that each development phase's products meet the conditions set out at the start of that phase, essentially checking if the product is built correctly.
	    - **Validation** ensures the final product meets the user's needs and expectations, confirming that the right product is built. V&V processes include thorough inspections and various testing methodologies, ensuring the software's correctness and completeness.
	4. **Metrics and Quality Measurements**:
	    
	    - Key metrics such as defect density, defect removal efficiency, and technical debt are monitored. These metrics provide insights into the software's quality and the efficiency of the development processes. By tracking these metrics, companies can identify areas for improvement and ensure the software meets high-quality standards.
	5. **Defect Management Techniques**:
	    
	    - Techniques like defect pooling and fault seeding are used to estimate the number of defects and assess the testing process's effectiveness. Effective defect management helps in identifying, categorizing, and resolving issues promptly, contributing to a more reliable software product.
	6. **Process Maturity Models (CMMI)**:
	    
	    - The Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) framework is employed to assess and improve an organization's software development processes. Higher levels of CMMI maturity indicate a well-structured, standardized, and predictable process, which is crucial for consistently producing high-quality software.
	
	Together, these components create a robust SQA system that supports continuous improvement, early detection and resolution of issues, and consistent delivery of high-quality software. Companies that effectively implement these practices are better positioned to meet user requirements and maintain high levels of customer satisfaction.

# Server-Side Programming in Java

### Description
Java Servers are generally ran using [[Apache Tomcat]] as the [[Java Servlet]] container, and built around frameworks such as [[Spring Boot]] and [[Jakarta]], and build tools such as [[Maven]] or [[Gradle]].

Database Connections can be made with [[JPA]], the standard API for accessing databases in Java, or [[Hibernate]], a popular Object-Relational Modelling Library in Java.
